## Your First Contribution ##
We follow [Github flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) make descriptive branch names. Name the branche with `feature/<ticket or description>` or `bugfix/<ticket or description>`.

## Project Structure ##
This repo contains the build tool to create a CLI that performs two tasks:
1. init - walks the user through cloning a git repo
2. styles - scrapes a Figma file finding colours, type, padding ...

The build tool is [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and TSC for the CLI module.

- TODO - How does the CLI work?

## Contributing Templates ##
- TODO - What structure should the content be?

## Testing ##
 - TODO - add instructions on how to add testing
 - TODO - what % of coverage does new code need to be added

## Coding Style ##
- TODO - Is there a typescript format that is considered standard
