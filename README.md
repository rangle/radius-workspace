# Radius - A Design System Accelerator #
The Radius design system starter kit is a collection of open-source tools and libraries that guide and help you to build your design system faster. Design systems need to match your brand and product needs, and your current and future digital workflows. Too much, too little, too complex, or too off-brand, and you will fight your design system as much as benefit from it.
